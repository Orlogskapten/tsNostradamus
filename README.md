A new time series forecasting business approach.

*This is an idea I get when I was working as a Data Scientist for Bouygues Telecom (for an internship).*

## Our methodology

## Usages

## Example

## Todo next
Many upgrades / issues have been discovered :
* Sometimes for a period, it don't find a model (stationary issues). Knowing that we are computing a mean of time series
 forecast, if for one period, it can't generate a model, then our weighted mean is not going to work (generate errors).

* For more complex time series, the fbprophet seems to well performed. We should implement it.
